Homework 1

changed the main.cpp file

put images in ./bin/pictures folder

HW 2

-old main.cpp is now in HW1 folder

new one contains all the raytracing logic + bonus part

-added all the libraries necessary for bonus part (fftw)

-added some basic implementation of the bonus part

-added glsl shader for part2

-reflections and shadows for part2 work fine

-refractions are kind of weird though
